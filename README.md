# SharedViewModels
This small sample project sharing view models between UIKit and SwiftUI. I wanted see what it would take to use the same view model class with a `SwiftUI` and `UIKit` view. In the iOS target of the app, the `ExampleView` is powered by `UIKit`, in the macOS target, it's powered by `SwiftUI`. This view model structure could be useful for when you need to use different frameworks on different platforms. It also keeps things simple, whether you're building a `SwiftUI` or `UIKit` view, the view model layer can stay the same.
